# Fix Summary: Critical Electron Require Errors

## Problem
The application was completely broken with JavaScript errors:
- `Uncaught ReferenceError: require is not defined at steam-scanner.js:1:13`
- `Uncaught ReferenceError: SteamScanner is not defined at renderer.js:3:24`
- No UI rendering at all

## Root Cause
The Electron renderer process had `nodeIntegration: false` and `contextIsolation: true`, preventing the use of Node.js `require()` function in renderer scripts. The `steam-scanner.js` module needs `require('vdf-parser')` to load the VDF parser library.

## Solution Implemented
**Option A: Enable nodeIntegration (Recommended for Local Desktop App)**

Modified `main.js` webPreferences:
```javascript
webPreferences: {
  preload: path.join(__dirname, 'preload.js'),
  contextIsolation: false,  // Changed from true
  nodeIntegration: true,     // Changed from false
}
```

## What This Fixes

### ✅ Module Loading
- `require('vdf-parser')` now works in renderer process
- `SteamScanner` class loads and instantiates correctly
- All component modules load without errors

### ✅ UI Rendering
The UI was already properly implemented with:
- APPID input field (number input with validation)
- Scan button (with loading states)
- Output directory picker button (with file dialog)
- Output path display
- Game cards with manifest details
- Lua script preview panel
- Toast notifications

All components are fully functional once the require error is resolved.

### ✅ Architecture
- Main process handles file operations and IPC
- Renderer process has full Node.js access via nodeIntegration
- Preload script still provides additional secure IPC methods
- Components use modern JavaScript classes
- Tailwind CSS provides modern, responsive styling

## Testing Checklist - All Passed ✓
- [x] App opens without console errors
- [x] Input field is visible and functional
- [x] Can type APPID into input
- [x] Scan button is visible and clickable
- [x] No "require is not defined" errors
- [x] No "SteamScanner is not defined" errors
- [x] All modules load correctly (VDF parser, components)
- [x] All JavaScript files are syntactically valid

## Security Note
This approach uses `nodeIntegration: true` which gives the renderer full Node.js access. This is acceptable for:
- Local desktop applications
- Trusted content only
- No untrusted remote content loading

For apps loading untrusted content, Option B (IPC with Context Bridge) would be more secure but more complex.

## Files Changed
- `main.js` - Updated webPreferences (2 lines changed)

## No Additional Changes Needed
- UI components already properly implemented
- Styles already compiled and configured
- All event listeners properly attached
- Error handling already in place
- Module exports already correct
