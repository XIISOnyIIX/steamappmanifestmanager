hotfix: Prevent auto-scan on app startup

EMERGENCY FIX: App was auto-scanning immediately on startup despite previous fix attempts.

## Changes

### Core Fix: Initialization Guard Pattern
- Added `isInitializing` flag to SteamManifestApp class
- Flag starts as `true` in constructor
- Set to `false` only after initialization completes
- All scan methods check this flag and return early if still initializing

### Guards Added (5 total)
1. renderer.js: scanAppId() - blocks scans during init
2. renderer.js: scanAllInstalledGames() - blocks scans during init
3. renderer.js: scanGameByAppId() - blocks scans during init
4. InputSection.js: handleScan() - blocks user-triggered scans during init
5. InputSection.js: handleToggleChange() - blocks UI updates during init

### Timing Fix
- Moved window.app assignment before app.initialize() call
- Allows InputSection guards to check app.isInitializing during init

### Debug Logging
- Added comprehensive trace logging to all scan entry points
- Added initialization progress logging
- Added guard block logging (⚠️ BLOCKED messages)

### Other Changes
- Updated .gitignore to exclude dist/ directory
- Created documentation files:
  - AUTO_SCAN_FIX_SUMMARY.md
  - TEST_PLAN_AUTO_SCAN_FIX.md
  - HOTFIX_CHANGES.md

## Impact
- NO breaking changes - all existing functionality preserved
- Guards only active during initialization (~1-2 seconds)
- After init completes, all scan features work normally
- Multiple layers of defense prevent ANY auto-scan triggers

## Testing
App should now:
✅ Start WITHOUT automatic scanning
✅ Show NO loading overlay on startup
✅ Default to "Single APPID" mode with toggle OFF
✅ Allow manual scans via button click
✅ Support both Single APPID and Scan All modes

See TEST_PLAN_AUTO_SCAN_FIX.md for comprehensive test cases.
