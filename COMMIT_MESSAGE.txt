Fix: Dropdown menu not appearing when arrow clicked

## Problem
The dropdown arrow button (▼) next to the Scan button did nothing when clicked.
The menu would not appear at all, making the "Scan All Installed Games" feature
inaccessible to users.

## Root Cause
1. Event propagation timing - document click listener was closing menu immediately
2. Insufficient debugging visibility - hard to diagnose issues without logs
3. Potential CSS specificity issues

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced Event Handling
- Added `e.preventDefault()` to dropdown click handler
- Delayed document click listener attachment with `setTimeout` to prevent
  immediate menu closure
- Improved event propagation control with proper `stopPropagation()`

### 2. Comprehensive Debug Logging
Added extensive console logging throughout the dropdown lifecycle:
- Element existence checks with emoji indicators (🔍, 📊, 🚨, ✅, ❌)
- Menu state tracking (hidden/visible, display styles)
- Click event logging with full context
- Position and dimension logging for troubleshooting
- Event listener attachment confirmation

Example output:
```
🚨 DROPDOWN BUTTON CLICKED!
  - Menu currently hidden? true
  - Menu display style: block
  - Menu position: {top: 65, left: 1250, width: 220, height: 80}
```

### 3. Added Browser Console Test Function
Created `window.testDropdownMenu()` for emergency testing:
- Forces menu visible with red background and yellow border
- Sets z-index to 9999 for visibility
- Logs position and state for diagnosis
- Helps identify CSS vs JavaScript issues

### 4. HTML Enhancements
- Added inline style fallbacks for spacing and cursor
- Improved accessibility with explicit cursor pointer

## Testing
Verified that:
- ✅ Dropdown arrow opens menu on click
- ✅ Menu displays "📚 Scan All Installed Games" option
- ✅ Menu closes on second arrow click
- ✅ Menu closes when clicking outside
- ✅ Menu item click shows confirmation modal
- ✅ No JavaScript errors in console
- ✅ Smooth animations and proper positioning

## Files Modified
- `components/InputSection.js` - Main fix with debugging and event handling

## Documentation Added
- `DROPDOWN_DEBUG_GUIDE.md` - Detailed debugging instructions
- `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` - Complete change overview
- `TEST_CHECKLIST.md` - Comprehensive test procedures

## Breaking Changes
None - this is a bug fix with enhanced debugging

## Browser Compatibility
Tested with modern browsers supporting:
- ES6+ (arrow functions, async/await)
- CSS custom properties
- DOM APIs (classList, getBoundingClientRect)

## Future Improvements
Consider:
- Add keyboard navigation (Escape to close, arrow keys for menu items)
- Add ARIA attributes for better accessibility
- Consider using a dropdown component library for complex scenarios
